# Mobile-Toy

This is a program to run a child's toy with five switches. Activiating each switch causes an LED to flash the same number of times as the LED number (e.g. the third LED flashes three times).

When all switches are on then a more impressive *Knight Rider*-style effect occurs. This branch includes an effect whereby the speed at which the 'Knight Rider' effect occurs speeds up with each loop.
